# Stake-Dice-Betting-Strategy
Repository Description This repository contains a web-based application for simulating a dice betting strategy. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and PHP, it uses the Martingale betting system to manage bets dynamically based on wins and losses. The backend employs a proxy to securely communicate with a dice game API.

Dynamic Bet Adjustment: Automatically adjusts bet amounts based on outcomes.
User-friendly Interface: Bootstrap-based design with live logging of results.
Win/Loss Tracking: Displays total wins and losses during the simulation.
Customizable Settings: Easy to modify the betting amount, target, and other parameters.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript (ES6+)
Backend: PHP with cURL for API communication
API: GraphQL-based dice game API
Additional Libraries: Axios for HTTP requests (optional)
